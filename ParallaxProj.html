        	My name is Karun Sekhar. I am a first generation Indian-American, and the only one of my direct family to be born in America. Essentially, I was born with better conditions immediately compared to the rest of my family, and I never let myself forget that. I was born at St. Peters Hospital and, at birth, was diagnosed with severe physical and allergy induced asthma and several allergies (a lot of allergies). Again, this is something that will stay with me for a very long time. In fact, most of my life becomes a battle with my health issues (walking pneumonia in the 5th grade, countless asthma attacks, etc.). About four months after I was born, my mother took baby me to India and raised me there for a little over a year. She did this because she believed it was best for me to have a strong foundation in my culture before growing up in a more privileged and culturally diverse environment. While in India, I went to school and made friends and knew Kannada (my mother tongue) and Hindi fluently. But after some time, I returned to our home in Old Bridge, NJ and started public school education from Kindergarten.
